# VR-Shooter-game
This is  VR game  more like FPS shooter game. This was made in unity software. This game works on point system and we earn points based of the kill we get in the game. I had lot of issues while building the game. This time the challenge was scripts couldn't recognize the unity software and I didn't know how to fix it but later I had a help from my friend. The main problem was I couldn't make a prefabs of enemy it was not working with the scripts but later when I added the enemy to prefabs the scripts wasn't supporting the enemy because of a bug caused by visual studio and unity later it was fixed now the source file is here but couldn't make apk out of it due to ndk error
